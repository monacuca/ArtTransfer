# ArtTransfer
Art Transfer for HAII Fall 2020 


The main goal of this project focuses on creating an accessible and interactive way of experimenting with ML models, in specific Fast Style Transfer models. In hopes of creating some transparency in the way these models work while incorporating a space for fun exploration. 

To create this interace, I utilized Fast Style Transfer Models for ML5.js that has been [pre-trained by Yining Shi](https://github.com/yining1023/fast_style_transfer_in_ML5/tree/master/models).

All code other than the usage of these models is my own, and made for the purposes of this class assignment. 

Some of the libraries are technologies I used for this project included: ML5.js (for loading and interacting with the models), HTML, CSS, Jquery (for a smart user interface and selecting multiple models).
